- To me, a growth mindset is where your abilities can be improved through hard work, dedication and persistance.  It's all about the attitude you bring towards facing new challanges and how determined you are to suceed in them.  You grow as you go and nothing is limited.
- 3 reminders to keep me in a growth mindset: Embrace challanges head on, failure is part of learning and it's how you will get better and achieve more understanding, put in the time to learn the most you can and put yourself in the best possbile position to grow as quickly as you can.
